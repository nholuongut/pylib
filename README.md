Python library, full of lots of validation code and utility functions.

## Build + Unit Tests

```shell
make &&
make test
```

[Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/nholuongut/pylib) is run on this repo to build and test it (around 450 unit tests, plus custom tests).

### Configuration

Strict validations include host/domain/FQDNs using TLDs which are populated from the official IANA list, a snapshot of which is shipped as part of this project.

To update the bundled official IANA TLD list with the latest valid TLDs do

```shell
make tld
```

#### Custom TLDs

If using bespoke internal domains such as `.local`, `.intranet`, `.vm`, `.cloud` etc. that aren't part of the official IANA TLD list then this is additionally supported via a custom configuration file ```resources/custom_tlds.txt``` containing one TLD per line, with support for # comment prefixes. Just add your bespoke internal TLD to the file and it will then pass the host/domain/fqdn validations.
